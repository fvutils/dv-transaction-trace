DV Transaction Trace Documentation
===================================

DV Transaction Trace (DVTT) is a library for recording and visualizing transactions 
in design verification. It provides a simple, flexible API for capturing high-level 
transaction information during simulation, enabling effective debug and analysis.

**Key Features:**

* Simple C API with minimal learning curve
* Organize transactions into logical streams
* Rich attribute types (integers, floats, strings, bit vectors)
* Visual debugging with color-coded transactions
* Multiple implementation options (DPI-C, standalone, vendor-specific)
* Flexible and extensible architecture

**Getting Started:**

For an introduction to the concepts behind transaction recording, start with 
:doc:`concepts`. To dive directly into the API, see :doc:`api_reference`. 
For practical usage patterns, check out :doc:`examples`.
